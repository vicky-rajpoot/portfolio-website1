  "summary": "AI/ML Engineer and Software Developer specializing in building intelligent systems that are both functional and deployable. With a strong foundation in full-stack web development and Drupal engineering, combined with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (A Grade) from London, I bridge the gap between training sophisticated ML models and integrating them into real-world applications. My expertise spans Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Transformer architectures, with hands-on experience in model optimization, quantization, and production deployment. What sets me apart is understanding both sides: how to build intelligent systems and how to deploy them from front-end to backend to production.",
